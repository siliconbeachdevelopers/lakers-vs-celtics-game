## Lakers vs Celtics

Cards consist of individual NBA players cards. 

Lakers and celtics each have 12 player cards in their stack each total. Including 3 wild cards on each side.

Each card holds the value of players Championship rings, career points, all-stars.

Each game type can be selected going head head on one of these statistcal areas. Select game type. Championship rings, career points, all-star apperances.

It begins with the game board.

The logic will randomly select 5 cards down on each players side. 

Player one will flip one card then Player 2 will flip one card.

Lets say the game selected is who has more Championship rings?

For instance :Player one flips Magic (5rings) player 2 flips pg cousy (6rings). cousy scores a 2pointer. So on and so forth for all 5 cards.

Who ever scores gets next move to pick a card.

After all 5 cards are flip this concludes the end of the 1st quarter.

All cards are put back in the stack and reshuffled every quarter.

There will be four quarters(4 sets of 5 cards flipped from each side)

The team that has the most points at the end of 4 quartes wins. 

There are 3 random wild cards on each side. A 3 pointer, a Block, and a Dunk.

If a player flips a block card your stats don't count and the opposing player wins match up.

If a player flips a 3 point card. His card trumps the other players card.

If a player flips a dunk card. "you got dunked on!" opposing players card is null.

At the end of four quarters a box will pop up on the screen showing the final score for each team.
